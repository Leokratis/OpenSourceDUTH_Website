# Code of Conduct
## Introduction

The OpenSource DUTH team aims to facilitate an environment that promotes, contributes and engages with the open-source community. We achieve this, in part, by behaving well towards each other, so that the broadest diversity of participants – both amateur and professional, new and experienced – feel that the work we do is welcoming and useful.

## Overview

This Code of Conduct represents the values and common sense we as a team look to uphold. Some of the basic social ingredients that hold our team, and our work together are:

- Be respectful towards each other
- Support others in the team and the open-source community
- Seek support
- Be collaborative

## Be Respectful

Respect is the foundation of our success as a team and every team member should feel comfortable and accepted. We are a group of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We work best when we treat each other with kindness and consideration by actively listening to different opinions, communicating clearly and generally being open to learning and recognizing the effort of others. 

We do not tolerate personal attacks, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination. Disagreement is inevitable from time to time, but it is important that we respect the other person’s views and beliefs. The contribution of each member to this team and to the broader FOSS community is always valued no matter how big or small it may seem to you. Respecting other people, their work and their contributions and assume well-meaning motivation before criticizing. Remember that by being a part of the OpenSource DUTH team means that you will interact with people from other backgrounds and that you may be unaware of important aspects of other cultures.

## Support others in the team and the open-source community

The best advantage of being part of a community or a team, is that the community meets you where you are and helps you grow. We all started somewhere and slowly became who we are now. Hence, you are expected to help and supports others on both personal and technical levels.

Lastly, supporting each other goes beyond simply helping in technical matters. If you witness others being attacked, think first about how you can offer them your personal support, and if the situation turns out to be something more than you are able to handle you may ask if you can assist with finding a more official support line for the person who is being attacked. 

## Seek Support

Being a university team, we do not expect our members to know everything, and we don’t require advanced expertise as a prerequisite to join the team. If you ever struggle with anything, feel free to ask anyone for help and be sure that they will be there to help you either by directly giving you assistance or pointing you to a resource for help. 

(Outside of technical things you are still welcome to seek help from the OpenSource DUTH team and resolve any disagreements you have)

## Be Collaborative

The open-source community depends on collaboration: it helps limit the duplication of effort while improving the quality of software produced by leveraging the power of large numbers and the diversity in opinions that accompanies it. Remember it’s easy to misunderstand emails (especially when they are not written in your native language) so when you are messaging someone try to be clear and concise. Ask for clarification if you are unsure of something in a written or verbal conversation and remember to always assume good intentions.

As a member of the OpenSource DUTH team and as a contributor to other projects you should try to adjust to any special requirements of other teams. As contributors on every project come and go do your best to always provide well documented code with clear and concise instructions and comments that explain each decision you made, in short, just try to do work that you are proud of doing. 

As a team member your feedback to the work of others is important, but poorly thought-out comments can cause pain and de-motivation so make sure to be positive and encouraging when providing constructive feedback.
